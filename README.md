# SethDev - Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio, an interactive and animated single-page website built with SvelteKit. It was designed to be my digital business card, showcasing my front-end development skills, projects, and interests.

*(Tip: You can record a short GIF of the animation using a tool like [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) or [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/), upload it to a service like Imgur, and then replace the link above.)*

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dynamic Profile Animation**: A fluid animation that reveals information about me, featuring a "fire trail" effect created with pure CSS.
- **Automated Projects via GitHub API**: The projects section updates automatically by fetching my latest public repositories directly from my GitHub account, eliminating the need for manual updates.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The site automatically detects the visitor's browser language and displays content in either Romanian or English.
- **Modern Design (Glassmorphism)**: The interface uses a "frosted glass" style (glassmorphism) for a clean and modern look.
- **SEO & Social Media Optimized**: Comprehensive meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD) for optimal Google indexing and perfect link previews on social platforms like Discord or Twitter.
- **Fully Responsive**: The design seamlessly adapts to any device, from desktop to mobile.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [**SvelteKit**](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Development

To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below.

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or newer) installed.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sethdev17/about-me.git
cd about-me
```
3. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```
4. Configure Environment (Crucial Step)
The project uses the GitHub API to fetch repositories. To avoid rate limits, a personal access token is required.
Create a .env file in the root of the project.
Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token. You only need the public_repo scope.
Add the token to your .env file:
 ```
 nano .env

# Your personal token from GitHub
GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
5. Run the Development Server
Once everything is configured, start the development server:
```
npm run dev

# Or start the server and open it in a new browser tab:
npm run dev -- --open
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.
